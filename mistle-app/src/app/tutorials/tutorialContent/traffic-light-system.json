  "title": "State Machine Diagram: Traffic Light System",
  "diagram1": "A state machine diagram, also known as a state diagram or finite state machine (FSM) diagram, is a behavioral diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) used to model the behavior of a system or entity with a finite number of states. It illustrates the transitions between states in response to events or stimuli, capturing the dynamic behavior of the system over time.",
  "diagram2": "State machine diagrams are useful for modeling the behavior of systems with complex, dynamic behavior, such as user interfaces, control systems, communication protocols, and business processes. They provide a visual representation of the state transitions and event-driven behavior of the system, helping to analyze, design, and implement systems with clear and well-defined behavior.",
  "content1": "A traffic light system is a control mechanism used at intersections or road junctions to manage the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It consists of traffic lights, signal controllers, sensors, and signage designed to regulate the movement of vehicles and ensure safety on the roads.",
  "content2": "Creating a state diagram for a traffic light system involves representing the various states of the traffic lights (such as red, yellow, and green) and the transitions between these states based on certain conditions (such as timers or sensor inputs).",
  "h1": "1. Identify States:",
  "li1": "Begin by identifying the different states that the traffic lights can be in. Typically, a traffic light system has three main states: red, yellow (or amber), and green. Each state represents a different signal displayed to vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "h2": "2. Define Transitions: ",
  "li2": "Determine the conditions or events that trigger transitions between states. For example, transitions from green to yellow may be triggered by a timer reaching a certain threshold, indicating that the green light is about to change.",
  "h3": "3. Draw State Diagram:",
  "li3": "Draw a state diagram using UML notation, with each state represented as a rounded rectangle and transitions represented as arrows between states. Label each state with its name (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow) and each transition with the condition or event that triggers it (e.g., TimerExpired, VehicleDetection).",
  "h4": "4. Specify Actions:",
  "li4": "Optionally, specify any actions or behaviors associated with each state or transition. For example, you may indicate that when transitioning from green to yellow, the system activates a warning signal to alert drivers of the impending change.",
