  "diagram1": "A sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that illustrates how objects interact in a particular scenario of a system. It represents the sequence of messages exchanged between objects or components within the system over time.",
  "diagram2": "Sequence diagrams are widely used in software development to visualize and analyze the behavior of systems, identify communication patterns between objects, and ensure the proper sequencing of operations during system execution. They provide valuable insights into the dynamic aspects of software systems and help stakeholders understand how different components interact to fulfill system requirements.",
  "content1": "A messaging app, also known as a chat app, is a software application that enables users to communicate with each other in real-time through text, voice, or video messages. These apps have become increasingly popular as a convenient and efficient way to stay connected with friends, family, colleagues, and communities.",
  "content2": "To create a sequence diagram for a messaging app illustrating the communication between various components, such as users, servers, and notifications, during the process of sending and receiving messages, following steps are followed:",
  "h1": "1. Identify Actors and Components:",
  "li1": "Begin by identifying the key actors and components involved in the messaging app system. This may include users, messaging servers, notification services, and other relevant entities.",
  "h2": "2. Define Messages and Actions:",
  "li2": "Define the messages exchanged between the actors and components to perform the messaging process. Messages represent actions or requests made by one object to another.",
  "h3": "3. Sequence of Steps: ",
  "li3": "Draw sequence of steps involved in the messaging process, including sending messages, receiving messages, and handling notifications. Start with a user initiating a message, followed by the message being sent to the server, delivered to the recipient, and acknowledged by the recipient.",
  "h4": "4. Draw Lifelines and Messages:",
  "li4": "Draw lifelines for the actors and components vertically on the diagram. Place the lifelines in the order of their involvement in the sequence. Then, draw arrows between the lifelines to represent the messages exchanged between them. Label each arrow with the name of the message being sent.",
  "h5": "5. Add Paths and Decisions:",
  "li5": "Include optional paths and decision points in the sequence diagram to account for alternative scenarios or user choices during the messaging process.",
